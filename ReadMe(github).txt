This is my first time posting my original project to github, I hope there is no problem caused by this action.

Inside dist folder is the usable app of app_launcher3.pyw which does not require python and its modules.
it still not complete yet, with the major problem for now is the GUI compatibility for 1080p resolution and some minor problem that ignorable.
The only 1080p monitor i can use at the moment is my mother's laptop, so fixing GUI for 1080p could be taking long time for me.
